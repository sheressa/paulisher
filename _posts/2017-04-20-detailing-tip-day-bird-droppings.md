<h2>BIRD DROPPINGS</h2>
Always attend to bird droppings as soon as possible or as soon as you notice them. These annoying droppings are very acidic and they can quickly harm your paint especially on hot sunny days. This is why it’s a good idea to keep up your car’s finish and wax it regularly. When cleaning bird droppings, resist the temptation to scrub hard as this can cause scratches. Never use scrub pads, terry cloth towels or sponges on your car’s finish because they too can scratch your paint. It’s best to use micro-fiber towels and a soft touch for best results. You can spray the area with your favorite glass cleaner and then “dab” the area to remove the offending material. If the poop is still stuck to your paint you can soak a towel and place it over the crusty part for several minutes to soften it. You should do this in the shade and check it periodically so you don’t cause another problem, water spots.
