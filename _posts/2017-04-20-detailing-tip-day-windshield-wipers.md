<h2>Itâ€™s been said that twenty percent of all vehicle accidents result from impaired vision caused by a dirty or damp windshield and one million accidents could be avoided annually with proper windshield wiper maintenance. In San Diego windshield wipers are rarely used but UV rays, dirt and oxidation are constantly deteriorating them. Experts say wiper blades should be changed every six months and the average person changes their windshield wipers every two to three years. Do yourself a favor and check your windshield wipers before you need to use them. Contact us if you have any questions regarding auto glass repair or replacement.</h2>
