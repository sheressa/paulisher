<h2></h2>
The ceiling of your car is also known as the headliner. Headliners can be delicate so you should use great care when cleaning them. Some headliners are made of a felt material that is glued to a piece of molded cardboard. With these headliners you have to be careful not to saturate the surface so you donâ€™t dissolve the glue and cause the headliner to sag. The safest way to clean these headliners is to use two terry cloth towels and a good carpet cleaner or degreaser. You can adjust the concentration by wetting the towel before you spray your product on it. Always start with a small area to test for colorfastness. If the cleaner removes or changes the color you might want to stop and reevaluate, you could call a professional. To clean your headliner, take one towel and spray the cleaner on it. Do not spray cleaner directly onto your headliner because this could dissolve the glue. Take the terry cloth towel with the cleaner on it and lightly rub a 2-foot by 2-foot section of your headliner in a back and forth straight motion. This will loosen dirt and pick up most of it. Then you follow directly with the dry terry cloth towel to pick up remaining dirt.
