<span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>What will a windshield repair look like when it’s done, will I still be able to see it?</strong></span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;">We can usually clear up the appearance of the damaged area from 70% to 90% and give you a 100% guarantee that the crack or chip doesn’t spread. Every windshield crack is different. Determining factors are how long it’s been there, how much damage is present and if there is contamination in the damaged area. Usually, the pit area of the repair will look like a small water spot so it will not be completely invisible.</span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>If you can’t repair my windshield can you have it replaced?</strong></span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;">Yes, we have expert technicians and use quality auto glass and urethane adhesives for your safety. All installations carry a guarantee against wind noise and water intrusion.</span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Can you come to my home or office and replace my windshield?</strong></span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;">Yes, we can deliver you the same convenient service for your auto glass needs as we have for your car’s appearance since 1980. In fact, the majority of windshield replacements are done on a mobile basis. The tools and equipment used to do windshield repairs and replacements are perfectly suited for mobile service. So why drop off your car or wait around in a glass shop?</span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>How long will it take to replace my windshield and how soon can I drive my car after it‘s been replaced?</strong></span>

<span style="color: #ffffff;">It usually takes about an hour to replace your windshield, and about another hour for the adhesive to cure to a point where it is safe to drive your vehicle. In total, you should plan on letting your vehicle sit for two to two and a half hours.</span>
