<h1><span style="color: #339966;">Most Common Concerns With Customers</span></h1>
<h2><span style="color: #339966;">Auto Paint Correction</span></h2>
There are three common concerns that my customers have with their car’s finish and they are fallout, micro scratches, and water spots. If these concerns are not corrected they will likely shorten the life of your paint as well as your enthusiasm for your car.

1) In the last ten years, you have probably heard the term fallout or industrial fallout used by a detailer. You will know if there is fallout on your finish by inspecting it after a thorough washing. When your car is clean, lightly rub the back of your hand across the hood of your car. If it feels a little rough you probably have fallout on your paint. If you look closely you will see a bunch of tiny specks and they won’t come off with a regular washing or even if you wax your car. If the fallout has been there a while, the specks will begin to rust and can eventually pit your clear coat. If you have fallout, the best way to remedy the problem is a professional clay bar. This clay process will remove the fallout and most everything else without removing any of your original paint or clear coat. A car that is professionally detailed with a clay bar will feel silky smooth and look better longer.

2) Micro scratches or spider webbing are common problems with today’s car finishes. The reason is that most cars today are finished with a clear coat. Clear coats do a great job of protecting the color coat from oxidation but the deeper shine shows more scratches. The darker the color, the more it shows off scratches and imperfections. Black cars are the worst in this regard. The most common mistake I’ve seen other detailer’s make is to use the wrong abrasive or a wool buff pad with a high speed polisher to remove scratches. What they leave behind is buffer swirls which many times look worse that the scratches did.

We only use clear coat compounds, polishes and glazes that are designed for today’s modern paint finishes. We also use a variety of foam pads as well as an orbital polisher to ensure a swirl free finish and the deepest shine possible.

3) Water spots are another culprit common to Southern California. We get our water from the Colorado River and it is full of dissolved minerals that cause the water spots. It doesn’t take long for water spots to damage your paint so they should be removed right away. The dissolved minerals act like a magnifying glass in the hot sun and can etch your paint leaving a permanent mark if they’re left there too long. When we remove water spots we use a chemical to remove the dissolved minerals, then we polish the surface usually removing all the damage. In some cases, the etching is too extensive to repair by polishing in which case we will let you know and give you our best recommendation.
