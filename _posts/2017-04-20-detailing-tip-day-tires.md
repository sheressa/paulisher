Winter is here and if you haven’t checked your tires yet for tread wear and proper tire pressure you might want to take a quick look at them. Look to make sure your tires are wearing evenly and that the tread is not worn below the wear bar which is usually 2/32” deep. Another way to determine the tread depth is by using a penny. Place a penny in each tire grove with Lincoln’s head facing you upside down. If part of Lincoln’s head is always covered by the tread, you have more than 2/32″ of tread depth remaining. It doesn’t rain here that much in San Diego but when it does the roads can be especially slick so for your own safety check your tires.
