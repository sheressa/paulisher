I don’t care who you are or what you use, cleaning car windows so they are streak free is not all that easy especially on a hot summer day. For really clean windows you have to remove all the oils, bug marks and grime first. I like to use a bug scrubber for this step. Then I like to finish with a good household liquid glass cleaner and a plush new micro-fiber towel. I haven’t used a foam aerosol glass cleaner yet that works any better than good old Windex. It’s best to finish your windows in the sun so you can see and remove all the streaks. You might try to use a vertical motion for the exterior, and a horizontal motion for the interior so you can tell which side the streaks are on. With a little practice your windows will start looking better than ever. So get out there and start practicing.
