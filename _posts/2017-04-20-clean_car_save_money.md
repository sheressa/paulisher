<h2><span style="color: #339966;">FOUR WAYS TO SAVE MONEY ON GAS</span></h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Buy regular unleaded gasoline unless otherwise recommended by your auto manufacturer and buy fuel from a reputable gas station. A customer of mine checked her gas mileage after filling up several times at a cheap local independent gas station and she was actually getting worse gas mileage than before. The independent station was the cheapest in the area but when you factor in the lower gas mileage you’re not saving any money. I think most people buy the cheapest gas they can but few of us are regularly checking our mileage and some of us are buying premium gasoline even though our car’s don’t require it. It’s best to refer to your owners manual however buying premium gas when it’s not required won’t get you better fuel economy or performance.</li>
 	<li>Tighten you gas cap. A loose or worn gas cap will cause more fuel to evaporate and cost you money. Also my mechanic told me that when cars come into his shop because their check engine light is on that 90% of the time it’s because of a faulty or loose gas cap.</li>
 	<li>Don’t top off. If you continue to fill your tank after the automatic nozzle clicks of it’s a waste of money and is not good for our environment.</li>
 	<li>Use shade. Direct hot summer sun causes a greater amount of evaporation emissions to occur than if you park in the shade. So park your car in the shade of a building or tree whenever possible. A windshield shade can also help.</li>
</ol>
Does a clean car improve gas mileage? Probably not much unless you are driving around with clumps of dirt on your car but driving a clean and well detailed car sure feels good.
