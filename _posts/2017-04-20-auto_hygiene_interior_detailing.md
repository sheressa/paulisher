<h2><span style="color: #339966;">There’s more to interior detailing than meets the eye</span></h2>
Is your car a breeding ground for germs and mold? Think about it, many of us are so busy that our car doubles as an extra office and fast food booth. We spill food, soda, juice and coffee all over the interior of your car. Not to mention all the sneezing and coughing. If you have small children have you ever looked closely at your child’s car seat? University of Arizona microbiologist Dr. Chuck Gerbafound that your car could be one of the moldiest forms of public transportation. Your car could have millions of bacteria on the door handled, seats and on the carpet. So how long has it been since your car’s interior was was deep cleaned and disinfected? When you are ready to have a professional interior detailing or complete auto detail ask us about our bio-friendly cleaning products and our enzyme odor dig ester.
